## Restore original signal after sampling and quantization technique

#### Project Purpose
- To understand the process of sampling and quantization.
- To see how much the original signal and the restoration signal match.

#### Project Procedure
- Generate original signal
- Sampling
- Quantization
- Encoding
- Decoding
- Calculate average quantization noise power
- Signal restoring

#### Result
